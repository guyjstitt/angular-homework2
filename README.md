#Instructions: #
##Step one: ##
Using JQuery, BootStrap, and Angular.js, take the JSON in [tutorials.json](/tutorials.json "tutorials.json") and create a create a list that of all the elements in the json. In other words, it should show images (all the same size), the title of the tutorial, and clickable url (that opens in a new page/tab) in a well formed layout. You should not just dump the text to the screen. Take pride in how this looks. The example should allow filtering, sorting, and look great! I would also like you to use routes with Angular example. Please search on how to do this.

##Step two:##
Create an HTML post that introduces angular and explains step one to someone who is new to Angular.js. Use text, use screencaptures, use whatever you like, but this blog post should demonstrate angular and explain it well using your example. Step two should be hosted in gh-pages. You code for the example should be in a project in github.

**NOTE: You should layout your page with css and bootstrap, and it should look good. You are completely free (in fact you are encouraged to use any template you choose to use to do this). I used bootstrap and jeykll (a flatfile blogging system for mine)**
